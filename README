This is an enhanced Alt-Tab for Cinnamon. It builds on the built-in Alt-Tab and
expands the feature set with multi-workspace capabilities and other useful 
features for the advanced user while working almost exactly like the built-in
version for the normal user. One of the features is a quick-help screen, accessed
by pressing F1 with Alt-Tab open. To enable multi-workspace support for the current
session, press the Plus key within Alt-Tab, and press Minus to disable it.
